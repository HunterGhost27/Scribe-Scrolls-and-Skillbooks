# **Scribe Scrolls and Skillbooks**

## Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

----------

The mod lets you scribe copies of _scrolls_ and _skill-books_ in your inventory without having to re-craft them from scratch. If you hate scouring the world and waiting hours for traders to restock, to find the right ingredients for those incredibly OP skin-graft or apotheosis scrolls; or perhaps you don't understand why your scholar can't use a quill to preserve the knowledge from those skill-books by simply writing it all down; or maybe you just love roleplaying a scroll-mage that wants to mass-produce and build a monopoly on selling chicken-claw scrolls.
if so, then this mod is for you.

## About the Mod

### Background

The most fun I had playing DOS2 was with an _Ambidextrous, Five-Star-Dining, Staff-Slinging Battlemage_. The build revolved around the use of consumables and literally scaled off of gold (and crafting ingredients). After a complete playthrough, I felt that scroll-crafting in DOS2 was implemented more like a bonus feature and wasn't really meant to be an integral part of builds. The crafting system, in general, felt like an afterthought. I made this mod to make scrolls more accessible, so much so, you can make builds around it.

### Features

The mod allows you to use **Inkpots-&-Quills** to _copy_ any _skill-book_ on a _blank skill-book_ of the corresponding type and tier. So you can preserve the knowledge and share it among your party members before you inevitably devour it. or you could just sell the copies for profits. Why are skill books consumable you ask? - I honestly don't know; balance reasons probably.

Scrolls aren't as easy to scribe however, for all I know, skill-books are just written instructions that the characters learn and have to perform themselves using their capabilities (magical or otherwise); Scrolls, on the other hand, contain the magic within them as they are accessible to anyone who reads them. Thus, to copy scrolls you also need the corresponding **Elemental-Essence** (Air Essence, Shadow Essence, Tormented Soul etc.) in addition to the _Original Scroll, Inkpots-and-Quills_ and a _Sheet of paper_. This puts some limitation on how many scrolls you can scribe, without having to pray to RNGesus for the crafting ingredients. Essences are a finite but readily available resource.

**Note**: You don't need chicken-claws, nails or large-antlers etc. to scribe a scroll, like you would for crafting them, you just need the Essence. _Source Skills require Source-Orbs instead of Essences_. Scribing a scroll or skill-book will not consume the original, this mod wouldn't be much of an upgrade otherwise.

### Recipes

* **Leather Cover** + **Needle and Thread** + **Sheet of Paper** X 3 = **Blank Skillbook**.
    _(Used for Warfare, Huntsman and Scoundrel Skills; While making this mod I realized that there were no Blank Skillbooks for them, so I had to make a new one. This book also works for higher-tier skills.)_
* **Cutting Tool** + **Feather** = **Quill**
* **Quill** + **Inkpot** = **Inkpot-&-Quill** (Shocking, I know)
* **Original Scroll** + **Inkpot-&-Quill** + **Blank Paper Sheet** + **Corresponding Essense/SourceOrb** = **Original Scroll** + **New Scroll**
* **Original Skillbook** + **Inkpot-&-Quill** + **Corresponding Blank Skill Book** = **Original Skillbook** + **New Skillbook**

## Compatibility and Known Issues

* While pretty much everything will **work fine without Larian's Crafter-Kit Giftbag**. I see absolutely no reason not to use it. If you really don't want to use the gift bag, then you will have to find Quills and substitute Leather Cover with Leather Scraps.

## Frequently-Asked-Questions (FAQs)

* **Q: There are barely any comments here, this Frequently-Asked-Questions section is a lie.**
* ***A***: you're right.

## Highly-Anticipated-Questions (HAQs)

* **Q: Does this work with modded skill books and scrolls?**
* ***A***: I'm sorry, No. The mod just contains recipes for base-game skills and scrolls because I had to create the recipes for each scroll and skill by hand. This was pretty much my first mod and I don't know of a better way to make crafting recipes. So you can't scribe modded skill books and scrolls unless I or someone else makes these crafting recipes for them. I might be willing to do it if I find the time and motivation; and the permission of the respective mod-authors.

* **Q: This mod breaks game-balance and should be considered cheating!**
* ***A***: I can go on for hours but I'll try to keep it brief.

    Game-balance is a subjective term. In a perfectly-balanced game, the player and the AI must have equal access to all gameplay mechanics (including saving and loading, perma-death etc.); and statistically, players must win/lose 50%/50% of the time.

    Games are, by design, biased towards the player having the advantage, so as to make the playing experience feel fun and rewarding. Every modification we make to said gameplay systems will inevitably alter the game-balance in either direction. So, in essence, every modification (even the ones that the Devs themselves make) breaks the preceding version's balance. What you must consider, however, is whether the new balance is something you consider acceptable to your idea of rewarding vs challenging. I hope that made some sense.

    _Too Long Doesn't Make Sense Version_: This mod will make scrolls much more accessible. If this is a mechanic you want in your game then that's what this mod offers. Otherwise not downloading this mod will keep your intended balance intact.
