[h1]Declutter Skill-Panel[/h1]
[h1]Divinity Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition[/h1]
<hr>
[b]Remove[/b] undesirable skills from your skill-panel. Are you playing with 15 class-mods that add several hundred new abilities? Do you find yourself repeatedly respeccing every hour trying to find the perfect build? You thought Flaming-Skin was super edgy but it turned out to be hot-garbage?, Not only were you scammed, it also has left a permanent mark in your spellbook to constantly remind you of your blunder?
Chances are, your skill-panel is FUBAR and needs some [i]declutterin'[/i]. Well, I've got just what you need.

[h1]Features[/h1]
The mod adds a unique artefact known as the [i][b]"Forgetinator"[/b][/i] that is able to selectively purge memories from the user. You can find it in one of the [i]torture-rooms[/i] in [b]Fort Joy Dungeons[/b]. It will also be added to your inventory automatically if you never picked it up, dropped it somewhere or have otherwise moved-on from Fort Joy.

How to use this mod:

[olist]
[*][b]Save[/b] your game before you go purging any skills.
[*]Open your [i]skill-panel[/i] (default: K) and hit [i]"Reset-All"[/i] or manually remove all memorized skills. (you can leave the ones you wish to remove memorized).
[*]Memorize only the skills that you wish to [b]remove[/b] from the character. Double-check.
[*][b]Use[/b] the Forgetinator from your inventory. BANG! Just fire and forget, literally.
[*]Make sure you don't regret what you've done. Reload if you do.
[/olist]
Works on mod-added skills too. Purge 'em ALL!!!

[h1]Alternate Fire-Mode[/h1]
[i]Combine[/i] the [i]Forgetinator[/i] with [i]Tongs[/i] to toggle safety features. Once turned [b]off[/b], the Forgetinator will remove every skill that is [i]NOT on any of your skillbars(/hotbars)[/i]. This includes [i]innate skills[/i], skills granted by [i]items[/i] (All-In, Shield-Up, Purge), skills granted by [i]statuses[/i](Fly, Medusa-Head) etc. If it's not on your hotbar, its a GONER.

[b]Exercise Extreme Caution[/b]: Removing something like [i]Source Vampirism[/i] or [i]Spirit Vision[/i] will probably brick your game. I'll advise you to [b]save[/b] your game before you remove skills and turn safeties ON again (by combining it with a Tong) after you're done.

[b]NOTE[/b]: The mod only removes skills from the character. It does not prevent the character from re-learning those skills - i.e. if a mod adds skills using scripts, those skills will probably reappear the next time you load your save. Same with skills granted by items. The skills are removed from the character and not the items itself, they'll be added to your character again when you next equip them or reload the save with them equipped.

[h1]UI-Components-Library Integration[/h1]
If you have the [b][url=https://github.com/HunterGhost27/UI-Components-Library]UI-Components-Library[/url][/b], you can toggle fire-modes by simply [i]right-clicking[/i] and selecting the [i]context-menu option[/i].
